# Machine Learning Frameworks

Machine Learning relies on algorithms. Unless you’re a data scientist or ML expert, these algorithms are very complicated to understand and work with.

A machine learning framework, then, simplifies machine learning algorithms. An ML framework is any tool, interface, or library that lets you develop ML models easily, without understanding the underlying algorithms.

There are a variety of machine learning frameworks, geared at different purposes. Nearly all ML the frameworks—those we discuss here and those we don’t—are written in Python. Python is the predominant machine learning programming language.
