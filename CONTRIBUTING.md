### Style

- Stay close to the existing style of the document when possible.
- Remember to focus on **brevity**, **specificity**, and **utility**.
- Avoid long explanations and instead prefer links to resources.

### Using issues and PRs

- Please **create and comment on issues freely** to discuss. A lot of the difficulty in accepting PRs is around style and format, and whether changes should be made at all, so rationale or explanations for the change are useful.
- Please **review open issues and pull requests** before submitting a new one, to help reduce duplication.
- To the extent possible, **break up changes into multiple PRs** so they can be approved separately. Large contributions are also welcome, but are harder and slower to approve, as they tend to require discussion or rewriting.
